        <h1>Our Impacts</h1>
        <p><strong>Child Protection:</strong> Over 200 children have been rehabilitated and reintegrated into society through our Child Care Institutions. These children now have access to education, counseling, and vocational training, ensuring a brighter future.</p>

        <p><strong>Livelihood Programs:</strong> More than 150 women artisans have been trained in jute and bamboo crafts. This training has enhanced their income by 40%, providing them with financial independence and confidence.</p>

        <p><strong>Health and Sanitation:</strong> Through the construction of 350 soak pits in tribal villages, JSVK has improved hygiene and sanitation for over 5,000 households. These initiatives have significantly reduced waterborne diseases.</p>

        <p><strong>Environmental Action:</strong> JSVK's afforestation drives have led to the plantation of 20,000 trees across 10 districts, contributing to climate resilience and environmental conservation.</p>

        <p><strong>Community Empowerment:</strong> By supporting village development plans for 52 tribal villages, JSVK has positively impacted over 20,000 individuals, addressing critical needs like water, sanitation, and livelihoods.</p>
