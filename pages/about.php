                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>CRY - Child Rights and You is an Indian NGO that believes in every child's right to a childhood - to
                    live, learn, grow and play. For over 40 years, CRY and its partners have worked with parents and
                    communities to ensure Lasting Change in the lives of more than 3 million underprivileged children.
                </p>
                <p>We work to ensure children's rights in remote villages and urban slums across 19 states in India. Our
                    programs focus on education, healthcare, protection from harm and abuse, and child participation.
